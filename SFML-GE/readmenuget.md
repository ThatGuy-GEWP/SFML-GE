SFML-GE is a Game engine built on top of the SFML framework
SFML-GE Provides an Entity Component System with naming and usage close to unity
Projects contain resources and scenes, scenes contain gameobjects with components

The engine is built for 2D games and could be used to make 2.5D games but that isnt offically supported

Features include:
A RenderingManager that takes care of sorting and rendering things by ZOrder
A Seperate Rendering queue for Screen Space Renderables
The ability to make custom components, and renderables
Some basic components like Sprite2D, GUIPanel's and more, made with the exact same tools and classes you use
A Fairly robust resource loading system
and more im forgetting here!
